# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- Configurable color/behavior thresholds: 17-field `Thresholds` struct in config with `mergeThresholds()` and `validateThresholds()` (3-step clamping: type → range → pair ordering)
- `/howl:threshold` skill for interactive threshold configuration (7 groups, view/reset, pair validation)
- CLAUDE.md for Claude Code onboarding

### Fixed

- Threshold validation hardened: negative values clamped to 0, percentages capped at 100, low/high pair ordering enforced
- 15 render functions refactored from hardcoded constants to `Thresholds` parameter (zero-value guard preserves backward compatibility)
- `workflow_dispatch` trigger added to release.yaml (fallback for auto-release tag push event race condition)

### Changed

- Test coverage 95.6% → 96.1% (113 → 139 tests, +26 threshold-specific tests)
- All documentation synced with custom thresholds feature (CLAUDE.md, README.md, skill files)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Dependabot for GitHub Actions (weekly grouped updates, `chore(deps)` prefix)
- Security Architecture section in SECURITY.md (trust model, subprocess inventory, credential handling, network egress, file system access)

### Fixed

- SHA-pin `upload-artifact@v4` → `v4.6.2` (last unpinned action across 9 workflows)
- Pin `govulncheck@latest` → `v1.1.4` for reproducible security scanning
- Add SHA256 checksum verification for Gitleaks binary download
- Separate concurrency groups: `auto-release` vs `release` (tag-triggered Release was skipped when sharing group)

### Changed

- SECURITY.md overhauled: realistic SLA for single-maintainer, expanded scope (10 items), 90-day embargo policy
- marketplace.json standardized for Anthropic Marketplace submission (kebab-case name, schema compliance)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Auto-sync plugin.json version in release pipeline (jq, idempotency guard)
- Comprehensive badge collection to README (7 → 24 badges)
- Comprehensive test enhancement (80.2% → 95.6% coverage, 113 tests + 284 subtests)

### Fixed

- Enforce CGO_ENABLED=0 in Makefile build target
- Split push in auto-release to prevent [skip ci] from blocking Release workflow

### Changed

- Auto-release pipeline: plugin.json version synced before tagging via jq
- Push strategy: separate branch push ([skip ci]) and tag push for correct workflow triggering

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- GitHub App authentication for auto-release workflow (replaces PAT)
- Complete release setup documentation (docs/RELEASE_SETUP.md)

### Changed

- Auto-release now uses GitHub App tokens (1-hour auto-expiry)
- Improved security: repository-scoped permissions, better audit trail

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Modular reusable workflows for CI/CD pipeline (9 workflows)
- Security scanning: govulncheck + Gitleaks CLI + weekly audit
- Auto-release with semantic versioning (svu)
- Pre-commit hooks: go mod tidy + conventional commits validation
- Comprehensive godoc comments for all exported symbols

### Fixed

- CI/CD workflow failures: govulncheck, gitleaks, release-build
- Release build dependency: add test to prevent broken releases
- Upgrade Go to 1.24.13 for TLS/x509 security patches (GO-2025-3420, GO-2025-3373)

### Changed

- Coverage threshold: adjusted to 75% (actual 80.2%)
- Disable Go module cache (zero external dependencies)
- Tests disabled in pre-commit hook (CI-only per expert panel)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- Support M suffix for 1M+ context window display
- Account email display for multi-account identification
- Claude Code plugin structure (Phase 1a)

### Fixed

- Upgrade golangci-lint-action v6 to v7

### Changed

- Code cleanup and stdlib usage improvements

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-07

- ANSI rendering with adaptive layout (2-4 lines normal, 2 lines danger mode)
- Git status display integration
- OAuth usage quota tracking (5h/7d)
- Transcript parsing for tools/agents display
- Release automation with GoReleaser and GitHub Actions
